# Whats the deal with Functional Programming anyway?

The deal, comes as a prepackeged understanding of many obscure but important concepts that are found scattered around the JavaScript dev environemnts, such as as [pure functional programming, and getting onto concurrent systems](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3175656/why-should-i-want-to-learn-haskell).

## Why even bother?

As explained in the link, getting the full experience without any compromises really pushes you over to the ledge between understanding and ignorance, the only issue is the steep incline that exists to that ledge. 

Plus, being a type safe language that is already built for concurrency might lend itself handy with the parallel processing of the future, *\****eh'm crypto***** who knows!

My main goal is to persue a different kind of web development, using [Obelisk-Reflex](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/obelisk). There might be something about being a quicker developer of ideas that is irresistible.

## Where is it used?

The crazy thing about Haskell, is how many [would praise its efficacy in industrial applications](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1604790/what-is-haskell-used-for-in-the-real-world?noredirect=1&lq=1), but is yet to produce any amount of work that many of newer languages managed to ship, such as GO. Still, some admirable projects using [Sigma by Facebook](https://engineering.fb.com/2015/06/26/security/fighting-spam-with-haskell/) is a living testement, so far.

One common complaint on using Haskell on webapps is the constant need to hold into the thoughts are the [`Applicatives` and `Monads`](http://learnyouahaskell.com/functors-applicative-functors-and-monoids), something I have vague ideas on but would require deeper understanding, soon. They are supposed to be easily dealt with within the Obelisk framwork.

## [How & When are we starting this out](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1012573/getting-started-with-haskell?rq=1)!

That is where we will be going [for next](initial-impression.md)!
