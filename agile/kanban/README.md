# Kanban as an Alternative Environment

Similar to scrum, kanban implements agile principles, along with real time communication. All work items are presented on the board with the state (not status) of each work at any time. Its identifiable by how visual the process is, and all work is usually presneted within the kanban board.

Cards are arranged by their workflow and how related they are. They start with a to-do column then an ongoing and finally a done column.

Still very similar to scrum, the differences are that there are **no sprints** in kanban, instead relies on certain events ie. **Event-drive** approach, therefore the **release** is also happen **continously**.

Scrum **changes** were still limited by each sprint till its end, but kanban has changes at literally any time. **Velocity** at kanban is measured by how long each feature takes from conception to completion, also called **lead time**.

Kanban **teams** are often **specialized**, and **cross functionality is optional**, everyone is a full-stack and is knowledgeable in their domain of work.

Therefore there are **no job roles** at kanban, thus making communication simpler in a highly productive environment. Representaion matters in kanban, as wether the card is finished or not, it stays on that board.
