# Agile as a Methodology

One of the biggest pains of organizations and tech startups has always been the attempt to reach maximum effeciency in terms of requirements delivery and customer satisfaction, along with keeping the developmental environment as optimal as possible for the development part of the team. Its a three-factor triangle that has been designed for whenever considering methodologies for such work, that is where agile fits into the big picture.

Agile represents the need to divide any project into **sprints**, these sprints take items from the **backlog** that contains all deliverables, chopped up nicely to fit in the timespan of 2 weeks maximum. These iterations help build up confidence and adapt to any changes that might occur inbetween sprints instead of the end of the project deadline.

### User Stories as the product

These stories represent what the features would eventually look like from the end-users perspective, in a simple and natural language. End users can be the external ones such as clients, and internal customers and colleagues.

No details of implementation goes into the user story, the behavior is set up and left as it is as the expected value to be delivered.

User stories are the main building blocks that produces epics (huge amount of work) and initiatives (multiple epics) that is then broken down further to manageable chunks that will be worked out into sprint tickets.

#### Pros

All of the above help ensure the **direction** of development, ease collaboration with ideas explained simply, and understand users better along with improved transparency as a direct consequence of having a high visibility of the scope of the project.

Along with that comes **reduced risks** since any blockers vocalized during standups are either resolved or is put up against the feature on per sprint basis. All flows supports iterative development.

#### Requirements

They must be valuable, as in users would see value in having such feature (not direct revenue), and as such other factors come in mind as knowing your target audience and market.

They must be estimable, as in someone in the team must have an idea of such implementation, otherwise unestimated story could waste lots of time in the exploration phase that might not be necessary, unlike exploration after estimation that represents possible alternative solutions and is not a blocker to development.

They must not be bigger than what could be completed on averagish of 40 hours (indicator only), otherwise should be broken down more to more stories.

They must be testable since all stories rely on certain outcome, that outcome cant be generic or unverifiable. This is usually called an acceptance criteria.

The format of the stories follows this sentence: _`As a [role], I [want to], [so that]`_ where `role` refers to a valid user base, and `want to` points to the feature, and finally `so that` tells us the expected outcome of the feature that could be testable.

### The 3C's of User Stories

- **Card**: where the story lives.
- **Conversation**: when the discussion happens and understanding is fostered.
- **Confirmation**: so that the requirements are met, and is represented by fulfilling certain conditions.

### Lifecycle

The flow generally looks like such as:

1. Pending: the very basic stage of analysis and user story creation by users.
2. ->> To-do: stakeholder disussions and prioritization, with explicit requirements and acceptance criteria.
3. ->> Discussions: Users confirmation of the above stage along with a preview.
4. ->> Developing: Features are then layed out by the team to design and implement.
5. ->> Confirming: Users confirmation of the results matching the acceptance criteria, after being tested.
6. ->> Finish: Any changes at this point requires new user stories.

### User Stories Mapping

The map (best made with [trello](https://trello.com/)) helps arrange the user stories where it could be grouped by functionality and is the backlog of the project. This is also where planning releases and value creation happens.

Difficulty is usually arranged from up to down, from less difficult to more. The left to right represents increasing priority. Best part of the map comes from the ability to focus on user value and hightlight any roadblocks that stops development of certain features.

## Agile Vs Waterfall

You might have worked in a waterfall methodology before, where projects are set up as series of coupled steps, where next step cant proceed without the full completion of the step before it, the difference are aparent when trying to do the following:

- Lifecycle: Agile promotes iteration and cycling, while waterfall take the full steps approach to completion.
- Rigidity: Due to the nature of workflow, waterfall intermediate changes affects the whole process and might require drastic changes, unlike agile that takes full advantage of the cycle to push changes interim.
- Collaboration: Because of the top down approach, any team member only responsible for one step, could then work on a totally different project after that step is done, making collaborative discussions and changes relatively hard to agile.
- Changes: Once the project kicks off, waterfall model rarely adhere to changes till completion, where the versioning helps keep it to date.
- Testing: Agile makes sure of end of sprint sessions to do full testings, where waterfall approach takes it till the end.
- Focus: Agile take the upperhand in terms of team interaction and customer satisfaction with its abilities expressed above, while waterfall makes sure the process is suitable and the product is satisfactory within the alloted time and resources (more suited for internal projects).

Thus the final note about projects, is that agile is more suitable for evolving projects, while waterfall has proven superior for projects that are well defined and is not expected to change much with time.
