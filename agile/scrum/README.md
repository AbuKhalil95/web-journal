# Scrum as an Environment

Scrum offers unparallaed way to improve learning from experiences, since collaboration is pushed for in sprint planning with the scrum master and product manager, and execution when each team member self assignes their tickets. The way the team organizes is all up to themselves, with all losses and victories are counted between sprints to try and improve upon the environment.

The **scrum master (SM)** facilitates daily standups to discuss the general work and how the sprint has been going so far, along with extra seperate sessions to help out on any diviation, so **visibility** is the main feature here, this is part of removing the impediments and support the team and protect them from _interferences_.

The **product owner (PO)** puts the features up on the list and prioritizes each feature for the next sprint with constant refinement and reprioritization as tickets might return to backlog if it was not done, or moved to the next sprint, or cut up into smaller chunks.

The collaborative nature among **scrum team** allows for cross up-skilling and knowledge transfer fairly easily, this will eventually give focus to **individual efforts** as they would provide invaluable insights on many parts of the project that will not go unnoticed.

This is environment is considered to be on of the most used and sometimes misused environment, depending on who is the product owner (do they exist for the team or for the client?) and how teams organize themselves (or not) towards deliverables and client needs.

## Scrum Artifacts

**Product Backlog** contains the list of all features, changes needed, bug fixes, or changes to infrastructure that will be eventually implemented.

**Sprint Backlog** is a subset of product backlog that represents the sprint goal once all items in this backlog are done, which is usually chosen by the team along with prioritzation from PO.

**Product Increment** refers to the increment of current product backlog tasks completed in a sprint, along with the increments of previous sprints, it helps envision overall progress. This is where the combined releases of sprints are pushed into production.

End of sprints usually represents a useable condition of the product, not necessarily if its released or not by PO (gone into testing).

## Big Framework Picture

The following represents the flow in a way similar to a hash table.

Product Backlog ->> Sprint Planning ->> Sprint Backlog ->> Daily Scrum ->> Sprint Review ->> Increment (Normal Flow)
Sprint Review ->> Sprint Retrospective ->> Sprint Planning (Part of all flows)
Sprint Review ->> Product Backlog (Tickets unfinished)

Active involvement of customers is another main feature as they will be involved not in sprint planning, or grooming but at retrospective that happens couple of sprints or so to self verify and provide direct feedback, this allows for quick **feedback-dependant** changes.

The benefits of such an environment is reflected in faster and effecient deliverables, along with saved time and money. This is also a direct consequence of projects being divided up to the sprints. This is very suitable for projects of short nature.

Speed or velocity comes as a consequence of proper deliverable and accurate estimations, but its never the centerpoint of any scrum sprint, the focus is on correct and valuable work.

## What happens in a sprint, stays in the sprint

### Sprint

This is the container where all scrum events happen in, starting in planning and ending at retrospective, the length is at maximum is 30 days.

### Sprint planning

Product backlog is checked, all scrum members are invited, then the items are picked off into the sprint backlog, allowing for goals to be set and be focused on all the way along the sprint.

### Daily scrum

Standups help clarify daily goals, clear up any blockers, but not turn it into a status meeting, PO's are usually not required to attend and if they do, they are not participants in the conversation.

Goals are inspected, progress is checked on, and a plan for the next 24hours are made.

### Sprint review

This is where the stakeholders meets the team and gets exposed to the increment, provide feedback and collaborate on decision making. Their collaborations affect the product backlog.

### Sprint retrospective

Here the team discussses what went well, and what can be improved, and what exactly can be improved for the next sprint. Happens right after the review with full participation of the scrum team (SM, PO and dev team). Discussions range from process to behavior to tools and what "done" means. This helps immensly when trying to adapt to work with others.

### Blockers and Such

Concise and well written wiki's do help make sure the blocker is well understood. Any immense task within the sprint should be documented first by the ticket assignee, then further deduced by others to its unblocked solution.

The timing of standups means that not much time could be allocated to discuss the blocker at that particular moment, so instead, people are assigned to help out at the moment's notice, when possible, and to keep track of that blocker for the remainder of the sprint.

Updates to the board is done immediatly so that the focus is turned to the conversation rather than the board itself since the meeting is short lived.

## Product Backlog Refinement

As a part of each sprint, the development team gets the chance to refine the product backlog, this helps reduce the backlog issues to more actionable level of detail, and reorder them so that the top are prioratized for understanding and selection for the next sprint planning.
