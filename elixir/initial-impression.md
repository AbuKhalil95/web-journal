## Right from the bat,
Erlang VM is mentioned (aka BEAM where Elixir is built on top of), that makes use of systems that are: 
- low-latency: high volume of processing at lower reponse delay.
- distributed: where a network of computers work on the same processing environment.
- fault-tolerant: keeps on running despite the erros, almost as if there was a [ton of try catch everywhere](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21586260/position-of-the-try-catch-statement) with logic to retry services etc..  

### But wait! Lets first [install](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html).
