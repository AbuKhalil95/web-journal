# The [Docs](https://elixir-lang.org)

## Right from the bat,
Erlang VM is mentioned (aka BEAM where Elixir is built on top of), that makes use of systems that are: 
- low-latency: high volume of processing at lower reponse delay.
- distributed: where a network of computers work on the same processing environment.
- fault-tolerant: keeps on running despite the erros, almost as if there was a [ton of try catch everywhere](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21586260/position-of-the-try-catch-statement) with logic to retry services etc..  

### But wait! Lets first [install](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/introduction.html).

## [`iex`](https://elixir-lang.org/getting-started/io-and-the-file-system.html#the-path-module) to Start Interactive.
Funtionalities that you could use at interactive are called modules, and the ones that will be mentioned are `IO`, `File` and `Path`.

### `IO`
Where Input Output magic happens, `:stdio`
