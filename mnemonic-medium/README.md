# Mnemonics 
Ever wondered what working hard vs working smart is all about? what do they even imply, or mean on their own? Here I will be exploring that concept under another theme of learning, studying and memorization.

Mnemonics are according to to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic), *is any learning technique that aids information retention or retrieval (remembering) in the human memory **for better understanding***. This might imply that understanding something and memorizing something are two inseperable aspects of knowing that thing. Looking at you, my Millennials and Gen Z aquitances.

However, things tend to go blurry on what works, and what not when dealing with such techniques. Here I will be exploring the following media content that tackles these issues for us, and hopefully extract insights to help me out.
